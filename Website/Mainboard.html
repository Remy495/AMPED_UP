  <h1>The Main Board:</h1>
  <p>
  The main board is a separate PCBA which houses several core processing components. A Teensy 4.1 is plugged into a socket here and provides the computations necessary to store and recall presets, 
  as well as evaluate the guitar signal and send updated motor positions to each motor. Also mounted to the mainboard is an ESP32 responsible for Bluetooth communication between the external 
  user-side software and the Teensy 4.1. The mainboard is directly connected to the guitar input buffer PCBA. This routes the incoming guitar signal through an op-amp buffer which offsets and amplifies 
  the peak voltage of the guitar to fall between 0 and 5V, providing a way of sampling the guitar input without directly interfering with its path to the guitar amp.
