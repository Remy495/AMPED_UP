  <h2>Amped-UP</h2>
  <p>The secret for many of the defining guitar tones across history can often be attributed to the relationship between the musician and their guitar amplifier.
  As a result, many lines of amplifiers have risen to fame, and the rich distortion provided by certain tube amps have become highly sought after.
  </p>
  <p>Amped Up! provides an exciting new way for guitarists to interact with their amp. 
	By connecting the knobs that control the tonal parameters of the amp to precise motors and rotational encoders, 
	we offer a method of storing and recalling presets that does not rely on a digital recreation of the amp’s sound.
	Moreover, we allow the artist to analyze the incoming signal in order to dynamically vary the position of each knob during play. 
	The result is an intelligent system that can be used to recall preferred sounds, maintain desired tonal characteristics during play, or create completely unique sounds.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our project includes user-end software which can be run on a laptop or computer and upload presets to the system via Bluetooth. In addition to creating static knob settings, 
  the software allows the user to define dynamic presets by connecting a diverse range of “nodes” to build up a customized response to several parameters, such as the guitar signal, 
  an expression pedal, and mathematical functions of time.
