  <h1>Amped-Up's UI</h1>
  <p>When it comes to interacting with all the hardware components from a user end, it was evident that we needed to make sure we allowed for lots of customizability that utilizes all the unique features of our Amplifier control system.
	To that end, Amped-Up actually has 2 different user interfaces. For thos of you that just want the ability to confiure static presets that can be recalled at a moments notice, we actually have a Basic User interface that allows for setting 
	and storage of static amplifier paramater values. This UI is somewhat limited, as it lacks the dynamicly changing features that our system was designed to perform. However, this UI serves as an easy method of "plugging and playing" that people
	may desire to just do some practice or show off to some friends.
