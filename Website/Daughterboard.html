  <h1>The Daughterboards:</h1>
  <p>
	The daughter board represents the main PCB design effort of the project. Each daughter board contains 3 main components, as well as supporting passives and connections for daisy-chained I2C and power. These are:
  </p>
  
</div>
<h3>Cortex M0 (ATSAMD21 E15B AUT):</h3>
<p>The main processor on each board, responsible for closed-loop stepper control, communications with the main board, and auto-calibration. Each is programmed in C and configures its
 I2C address through a DIP switch set by the user prior to use.</p>
<h3>Trinamic motor driver (TMC-2310-LA):</h3>
<p>These advanced motor drivers accept SPI configuration from the M0, as well as step/direction instructions. They are capable of driving the stepper motor with high levels of microstepping almost silently. 
They are also equipped with StallGuard current detection which is used to detect when a knob has been rotated to its limit during autocalibration.</p>
<h3>Magnetic encoder (TLE5012B):</h3>
<p>The magnetic encoder resides on the bottom-side of the daughter board and is positioned precisely above the back side of the motor shaft which bears a diametrically magnetized disk magnet.
 Using internal magnetoresistance, the chip communicates rotation to the M0 through a series of pulses which correspond to a rotational resolution in excess of 2000 counts/step.
